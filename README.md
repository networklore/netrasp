netrasp
=======

Netrasp is a package that communicates to network devices over SSH. It takes
care of handling the pty terminal of network devices giving you an API with
common actions such as executing commands and configuring devices.

Warning
-------
Netrasp is in pre release mode so some parts of the API might change before
the initial version is released.

Example
-------

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/networklore/netrasp/pkg/netrasp"
)

func main() {
	device, err := netrasp.New("switch1",
		netrasp.WithUsernamePassword("my_user", "my_password123"),
		netrasp.WithDriver("ios"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("unable to create client: %v", err)
	}

	ctx, cancelOpen := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2000*time.Millisecond)
	defer cancelOpen()
	err = device.Dial(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("unable to connect: %v\n", err)

		return
	}
	defer device.Close(context.Background())

	ctx, cancelRun := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 300*time.Millisecond)
	defer cancelRun()
	output, err := device.Run(ctx, "show running")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("unable to run command: %v\n", err)

		return
	}
	fmt.Println(output)
}
```

Network Device Support
----------------------
The initial release of Netrasp comes with support for the following platforms:

* Cisco IOS: netrasp.WithDriver("ios")
* Cisco NXOS: netrasp.WithDriver("nxos")
* Cisco ASA: netrasp.WithDriver("asa")
* Nokia SR OS: netrasp.WithDriver("sros")
* Juniper JunOS: netrasp.WithDriver("junos")

Use cases
---------

You can use Netrasp as a package as in the example above of combine it with
something like [Gornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/gornir) to get
the same type of experience you'd have from using [Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko)
and [Nornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir) in the Python world.

and recommendations of the structure and code.

SSH Crypto package
------------------

When creating Netrasp, I encountered an issue with Golang’s crypto package for
SSH. The problem is that the Read call when retrieving information from a device
is blocking, so it wasn’t possible to cancel that read using a Go context. As
I’m fairly new to Go, it could be just that I’m not aware of the correct way
to make the read cancelable without starting any goroutines that might remain
in the background. I only needed one line to be changed within the crypto/ssh
library, so I made a [fork](https://github.com/ogenstad/crypto) (referenced in
the go.mod file for Netrasp). In the file
https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/ssh/buffer.go, I needed to change
the Read() method. Instead of hanging at `b.Cond.Wait()`, I added `return 0, nil`.
Edit your local go.mod file if you want a similar replacement to avoid blocking
reads:
`replace golang.org/x/crypto => github.com/ogenstad/crypto v0.0.0-20210308070823-6d211c1ce3d7`
